- 👋 Hi there! I’m Nikki. (@iamnikkixo) 

- 🌱 I am a junior full-stack developer who has been exploring the MERN stack for over a year now, focusing on creating responsive and user-friendly designs. My expertise lies in crafting seamless experiences with React and Bootstrap on the frontend to make designs beautiful.

- 🛠️  I am currently exploring Tailwind CSS and Next.js, adding more tools to my developer toolkit to create more customizable designs and improve the frontend and backend integration.

- 🐶🥊 Apart from coding, I bring over 8 years of teaching and curriculum development experience to the table. When I'm not coding, you'll find me enjoying quality time with my corgi, Puddles, or at my Muay Thai training.

- 🤝 I'm eager to collaborate on projects that challenge conventions and bring innovation to the forefront. Let's create something amazing together! ✨.
